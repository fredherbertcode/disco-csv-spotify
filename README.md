- Show you statistics about successful matches and missing tracks

## CSV Format

The app expects Discogs CSV exports with these columns:
- `Artist` - The artist name
- `Title` - The release/album title
- `Catalog#` - Catalog number (optional)
- `Label` - Record label (optional)
- `Format` - Release format (optional)

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- Make sure you have a valid Spotify account
- Try refreshing the page if authentication fails
- Clear your browser cache if you encounter login issues

### CSV Parsing Issues
- Ensure your CSV file is from a Discogs collection export
- Check that the file has the expected column headers
- Files with special characters may need UTF-8 encoding

### Track Matching
- The app searches using exact artist and title matches
- Some tracks may not be found due to:
  - Different spelling or formatting
  - Track not available on Spotify
  - Compilation albums vs. individual tracks

## Rate Limiting

The app includes built-in delays to respect Spotify's API rate limits. Large collections may take several minutes to process.

## Privacy

- Your Spotify credentials are never stored
- CSV data is processed locally in your browser
- No data is sent to third-party servers except Spotify's API
